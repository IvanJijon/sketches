# Sketches

I enjoy playing with creative code libraries such as Processing, p5.js, ...

In general these are little projects and sketches that I create in order to test a new technology or to practice a programming concept/technique or just for fun.

In each mini-project, a short description of my goals will be provided and some comments about my approach.
